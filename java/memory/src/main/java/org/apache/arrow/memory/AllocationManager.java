/**
 * Manages the relationship between one or more allocators and a particular UDLE. Ensures that
 * one allocator owns the
 * memory that multiple allocators may be referencing. Manages a BufferLedger between each of its
 * associated allocators.
 * This class is also responsible for managing when memory is allocated and returned to the
 * Netty-based
 * PooledByteBufAllocatorL.
 *
 * <p>The only reason that this isn't package private is we're forced to put ArrowBuf in Netty's
 * package which need access
 * to these objects or methods.
 *
 * <p>Threading: AllocationManager manages thread-safety internally. Operations within the context
 * of a single BufferLedger
 * are lockless in nature and can be leveraged by multiple threads. Operations that cross the
 * context of two ledgers
 * will acquire a lock on the AllocationManager instance. Important note, there is one
 * AllocationManager per
 * UnsafeDirectLittleEndian buffer allocation. As such, there will be thousands of these in a
 * typical query. The
 * contention of acquiring a lock on AllocationManager should be very low.

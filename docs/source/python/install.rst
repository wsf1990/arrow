Installing PyArrow
==================

System Compatibility
--------------------

PyArrow is regularly built and tested on Windows, macOS and various Linux
distributions (including Ubuntu 16.04, Ubuntu 18.04).  We strongly recommend
using a 64-bit system.

Python Compatibility
--------------------

PyArrow pledges to maintain compatibility with Python 2.7 until the end of 2019.
Other than that, PyArrow is currently compatible with Python 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7.

Using Conda
-----------

Install the latest version of PyArrow from
`conda-forge <https://conda-forge.org/>`_ using `Conda <https://conda.io>`_:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install -c conda-forge pyarrow

Using Pip
---------

Install the latest version from `PyPI <https://pypi.org/>`_ (Windows, Linux,
and macOS):

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pyarrow

If you encounter any importing issues of the pip wheels on Windows, you may
need to install the `Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015
<https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145>`_.

.. note::

   Windows packages are only available for Python 3.5 and higher (this is also
   true for TensorFlow and any package that is implemented with modern C++).

Installing from source
----------------------

See :ref:`development`.

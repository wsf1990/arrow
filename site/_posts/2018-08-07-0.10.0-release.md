The Apache Arrow team is pleased to announce the 0.10.0 release. It is the
product of over 4 months of development and includes [**470 resolved
issues**][1]. It is the largest release so far in the project's history. 90
individuals contributed to this release.

See the [Install Page][2] to learn how to get the libraries for your
platform. The [complete changelog][3] is also available.

We discuss some highlights from the release and other project news in this
post.

## Offical Binary Packages and Packaging Automation

One of the largest projects in this release cycle was automating our build and
packaging tooling to be able to easily and reproducibly create a [comprehensive
set of binary artifacts][4] which have been approved and released by the Arrow
PMC. We developed a tool called **Crossbow** which uses Appveyor and Travis CI
to build each of the different supported packages on all 3 platforms (Linux,
macOS, and Windows). As a result of our efforts, we should be able to make more
frequent Arrow releases. This work was led by Phillip Cloud, Kouhei Sutou, and
Krisztián Szűcs. Bravo!

## New Programming Languages: Go, Ruby, Rust

This release also adds 3 new programming languages to the project: Go, Ruby,
and Rust. Together with C, C++, Java, JavaScript, and Python, **we now have
some level of support for 8 programming languages**.

## Upcoming Roadmap

In the coming months, we will be working to move Apache Arrow closer to a 1.0.0
release. We will continue to grow new features, improve performance and
stability, and expand support for currently supported and new programming
languages.

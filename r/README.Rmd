# arrow

R integration with Apache Arrow.

## Installation

First install a release build of the C++ bindings to arrow.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/apache/arrow.git
cd arrow/cpp && mkdir release && cd release

# It is important to statically link to boost libraries
cmake .. -DARROW_PARQUET=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DARROW_BOOST_USE_SHARED:BOOL=Off
make install
```

Then the R package:

```r
devtools::install_github("apache/arrow/r")
```

## Example

```{r}
library(arrow, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(tibble)
library(reticulate)

tf <- tempfile()

# write arrow::Table to file
(tib <- tibble(x = 1:10, y = rnorm(10)))
# arrow::write_arrow(tib, tf)

# # read it back with pyarrow
# pa <- import("pyarrow")
# as_tibble(pa$open_file(tf)$read_pandas())
```

# Native Rust implementation of Apache Arrow

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/apache/arrow.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/apache/arrow)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/apache/arrow/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/github/apache/arrow)

## Status

This is a native Rust implementation of Apache Arrow. Currently the project
is developed and tested against nightly Rust.  The current status is:

- [x] Primitive Arrays
- [x] List Arrays
- [x] Struct Arrays
- [x] CSV Reader
- [ ] CSV Writer
- [ ] Parquet Reader
- [ ] Parquet Writer
- [ ] Arrow IPC
- [ ] Interop tests with other implementations

## Examples

The examples folder shows how to construct some different types of Arrow
arrays, including dynamic arrays created at runtime.

Examples can be run using the `cargo run --example` command. For example:

```bash
cargo run --example builders
cargo run --example dynamic_types
cargo run --example read_csv
```

# Publishing to crates.io

An Arrow committer can publish this crate after an official project release has
been made to crates.io using the following instructions.

Follow [these
instructions](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/publishing.html) to
create an account and login to crates.io before asking to be added as an owner
of the [arrow crate](https://crates.io/crates/arrow).

Checkout the tag for the version to be released. For example:

```bash
git checkout apache-arrow-0.11.0
```

If the Cargo.toml in this tag already contains `version = "0.11.0"` (as it
should) then the crate can be published with the following command:

```bash
cargo publish
```

If the Cargo.toml does not have the correct version then it will be necessary
to modify it manually. Since there is now a modified file locally that is not
committed to github it will be necessary to use the following command.

```bash
cargo publish --allow-dirty
```
